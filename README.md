## Reading cognitive task data from SUCCAB computers 

These two scripts automatically take the poorly formatted .edat files from the SUCCAB cognitive task computers and process the data to a form which can be integrated with the main study datasets (e.g, in excel or SPSS format). The 'edat processing functions' file is the backend which provides the functions used to read/transform the data. It does not need to be used directly. The actual scoring and saving of new cognition data is performed with the 'reading SUCCAB R script' file. That file gives instructions on the process.
